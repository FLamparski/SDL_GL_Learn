Because stuff. Oh and I want to learn OpenGL + C even though it somehow seems like masochism.

# k how do I run this?

Make sure you have SDL 2.0, GLEW and OpenGL + their respective header files (on Debian these are the `-dev` packages).
Then you should be able to just `make` this.

# Right, but why am *I* here?

I wrote a cool Makefile that desperately tries to emulate the cool stuff I'd get if I was using Grunt. Turns out
that it works even slightly better than JS-based task files?
